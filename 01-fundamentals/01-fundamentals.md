# 01-fundamentals

## Learning goals

- Understand basic Python syntax and program structure.
- Work with variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
- Explain scope rules and basic class syntax.

## Key definitions

- `Variable`: a named reference to a value.
- `Expression`: code that evaluates to a value.
- `Statement`: instruction Python executes.
- `Scope`: region where a name can be accessed.
- `Function`: reusable block of logic.

## Core concepts

- Python is dynamically typed: variable names are not type-locked.
- Branching uses `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Iteration uses `for` and `while` loops.
- Functions improve reuse and readability.
- Scope follows LEGB: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing tabs/spaces in indentation.
- Assuming list and tuple behave the same.
- Overusing global variables.

## Quick recap

- Build logic with conditions and loops.
- Extract repeated logic into functions.
- Keep scope clear and predictable.
