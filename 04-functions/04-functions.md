# 04-functions

## Learning goals

- Define functions with clear inputs/outputs.
- Use parameters, defaults, and variable arguments.
- Understand local vs global state.

## Key definitions

- `Parameter`: variable declared in function signature.
- `Argument`: value passed at call time.
- `Return value`: output sent back by function.

## Core concepts

- Good functions do one focused task.
- Return values are better than direct printing for reuse.
- `*args` accepts variable positional arguments.
- Use `global` rarely and intentionally.

## Common mistakes

- Writing very long functions with mixed responsibilities.
- Relying on globals instead of passing parameters.

## Quick recap

- Small, pure, reusable functions are easiest to test and reason about.
