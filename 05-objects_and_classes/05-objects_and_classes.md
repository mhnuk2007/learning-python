# 05-objects_and_classes

## Learning goals

- Understand object identity, references, and mutability.
- Build and use basic classes.
- Explain instance attributes and methods.

## Key definitions

- `Object`: runtime instance with identity, type, and value/state.
- `Class`: blueprint for creating objects.
- `Method`: function defined inside a class.
- `Mutability`: whether an object can change in place.

## Core concepts

- Multiple variables can reference the same object.
- Mutable objects (like lists) can change without new identity.
- Immutable objects (like strings) create new objects when changed.
- Classes group related data and behavior.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing `is` (identity) with `==` (value equality).
- Accidentally sharing mutable state.

## Quick recap

- Identity and mutability are foundational for correct Python logic.
