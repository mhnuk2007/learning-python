# 06-inheritance_and_overriding

## Learning goals

- Reuse behavior via inheritance.
- Override parent methods in child classes.
- Keep hierarchy design simple and clear.

## Key definitions

- `Inheritance`: deriving a class from another class.
- `Subclass`: child class that extends parent behavior.
- `Method overriding`: subclass replaces parent implementation.

## Core concepts

- Parent class holds shared behavior.
- Subclasses add or specialize behavior.
- Overriding changes behavior while keeping interface familiar.

## Common mistakes

- Creating deep hierarchies for simple problems.
- Overriding methods without preserving expected behavior.

## Quick recap

- Inheritance is for shared behavior, not just code compression.
