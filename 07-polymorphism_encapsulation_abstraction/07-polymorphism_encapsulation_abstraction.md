# 07-polymorphism_encapsulation_abstraction

## Learning goals

- Explain core OOP principles in Python.
- Use encapsulation to protect state.
- Use abstraction to define required interfaces.

## Key definitions

- `Polymorphism`: same interface, different implementation.
- `Encapsulation`: controlled access to internal data.
- `Abstraction`: exposing essential behavior, hiding details.

## Core concepts

- Polymorphism enables generic code over many object types.
- Encapsulation improves safety and maintainability.
- Abstract base classes enforce required methods in subclasses.

## Common mistakes

- Treating private attributes as strict security instead of convention.
- Over-abstracting very small examples.

## Quick recap

- These principles make larger codebases easier to extend safely.
