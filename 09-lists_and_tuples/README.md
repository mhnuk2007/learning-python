# Chapter 09: Lists and Tuples

Sequence data structures in Python, including list operations, tuple behavior, and nested list indexing.

## Status

- Completed

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to run

```powershell
cd 09-lists_and_tuples
python .\lists.py
```

Replace `lists.py` with any file in this chapter.

## Files and topics

| File | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `lists.py` | Core list operations: append, index, replace, insert, pop, remove |
| `lists2.py` | Additional list practice with similar operations |
| `tuples.py` | Tuple indexing and immutability demonstration (`TypeError` on assignment) |
| `tuples2.py` | Tuple indexing and immutability demonstration (`TypeError` on assignment) |
| `multi-dimension-list.py` | 2D and 3D nested list indexing and iteration |
| `multi-dimension-list2.py` | Alternate nested list example with multi-level iteration |

## Notes

- `tuples.py` and `tuples2.py` intentionally raise an error to show tuples are immutable.
- Multi-dimensional list files show how to index nested structures by level.
