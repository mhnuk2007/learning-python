# Chapter 10: Stacks and Queues

Linear data structures in Python using LIFO stacks and FIFO queues.

## Status

- Completed

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to run

```powershell
cd 10-stacks_and_queues
python .\stacks.py
```

Replace `stacks.py` with any file in this chapter.

## Files and topics

| File | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `stacks.py` | Stack operations with list: `append()`, `pop()`, and empty-stack handling |
| `stacks2.py` | Stack practice example with clear LIFO flow |
| `queues.py` | Queue operations with `queue.Queue`: `put()`, `get()`, `get_nowait()`, `maxsize` |
| `queues2.py` | Queue practice example with FIFO and full/empty checks |

## Notes

- Stack examples use Python lists as LIFO structures.
- Queue examples use `queue.Queue` for FIFO behavior and safe full/empty handling.
