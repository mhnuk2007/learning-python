# 11-sets_and_dictionaries

## Learning goals

- Use sets for uniqueness and membership tests.
- Use dictionaries for key-value lookups and transformations.

## Key definitions

- `Set`: unordered collection of unique values.
- `Dictionary`: mapping of keys to values.
- `Hashing`: mechanism enabling fast lookups.

## Core concepts

- Sets support union, intersection, and difference.
- Dicts support efficient lookup/update by key.
- Dict and set comprehensions create collections concisely.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming set order is stable.
- Using mutable objects as dictionary keys.

## Quick recap

- Use sets for membership/uniqueness, dicts for structured lookup data.
