# 13-comprehensions

## Learning goals

- Build collections using concise comprehension syntax.
- Choose comprehensions vs loops based on readability.

## Key definitions

- `List comprehension`: compact list creation.
- `Set comprehension`: compact set creation.
- `Dict comprehension`: compact dict creation.
- `Generator expression`: lazy sequence expression.

## Core concepts

- Comprehensions are expressive for simple transformations.
- Filters can be added with trailing `if` clauses.
- Generator expressions avoid creating full intermediate collections.

## Common mistakes

- Writing very complex one-liners that reduce readability.
- Choosing comprehension where a loop is clearer.

## Quick recap

- Prefer comprehensions for short, readable transformation patterns.
