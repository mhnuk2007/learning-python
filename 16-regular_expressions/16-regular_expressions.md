# 16-regular_expressions

## Learning goals

- Match, extract, and replace text using regex.
- Use regex where pattern-based text processing is needed.

## Key definitions

- `Pattern`: regex expression used for matching.
- `Match`: object representing a successful match.
- `Capture group`: sub-pattern for extracting parts.

## Core concepts

- `re.search` finds first match.
- `re.findall` returns all matches.
- `re.sub` performs pattern-based replacement.
- Raw strings (`r"..."`) reduce escape confusion.

## Common mistakes

- Overusing regex for simple string methods.
- Forgetting to escape special characters.

## Quick recap

- Regex is powerful, but clarity matters; keep patterns simple when possible.
