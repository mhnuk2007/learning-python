# 18-misc_tools

## Learning goals

- Apply useful standard library helpers for day-to-day coding.

## Key definitions

- `random`: pseudo-random utilities.
- `itertools`: iterator building blocks.
- `functools`: functional programming helpers.

## Core concepts

- `random` helps with sampling/shuffling demos and simulations.
- `itertools` provides memory-efficient iteration tools.
- `functools.reduce` and related tools support functional patterns.

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting to set seed when deterministic output is needed.
- Using complex iterator chains when a simple loop is clearer.

## Quick recap

- These modules improve productivity for utility scripts and data tasks.
